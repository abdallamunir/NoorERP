NoorERP MVP sprint 1:
TASK 1: building the core system and base module

	Core: a class library containg the core abstract classes & interfaces for the entire system
		Classes:
			- BaseModel (abstract): the base model class all models in the system inherit contains metadata properties
			  about the object like id,name,label,fields,indexable,auditable .. etc these properties aid in control behaviour in 
			  data layer & UI layer.
			- BaseField (Abstract): base field class containing metadata props 
			- Fields.cs (collection of classes): group of field classes implementing BaseField such as TextField, IntField ..etc
 			- Security.cs (collection of classes): provide RecordPermissions & FieldPermissions classes
			- ModuleRegistry: reperesent properties about module metadata and essential methods such as GetActiveModules()
			- ModuleManager: provides functionality for discovering & loading other modules
		Interfaces:
			- IModule: module metadata & methods such as Initilize(), Load(),Deactivate()

------------
	BaseModule: the base of the NoorERP and provide functionality for creating the Modules registery,registering itself as the base module
		    and providing user authentication and module managment where other modules discovered and loaded into the system
